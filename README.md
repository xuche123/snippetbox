# SnippetBox Web Application

SnippetBox is a simple web application built in Go that allows users to create and view code snippets.

## Overview

The application uses the net/http package to handle requests and responses, html/template for views, and a SQL database for storing data. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern and organizes code into different packages based on functionality.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Creating, viewing, and managing code snippets
- Flash messages for user interaction feedback
- Secure cookies for session management

## Usage

To run the application, navigate to the project directory and use the `go run` command:

```bash
go run ./cmd/web
```

This will start the server, and the application will be accessible at `localhost:4000`.

## Installation

To install the application, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snippetbox.git
cd snippetbox
go get
```

Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/snippetbox.git` with the actual path to your repository.
